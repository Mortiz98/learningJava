üß† Learning Java
This repository contains a collection of exercises and small projects developed as part of my journey to learn the Java programming language. The topics range from the basics (operators, conditionals, loops) to more structured applications like calculators, inventory managers, and sales systems.

üìÅ Repository Structure
Each folder contains one or more .java files that cover a specific concept or solve a particular problem.

Folder / Project	Description
Administrador_de_ventas	Mini system to manage sales
Arreglos	Exercises with arrays (vectors)
Cajero_automatico	ATM simulation
Calculadora_basica	Basic calculator with standard operations
Ciclos_y_bucles	Exercises with loop structures
Condicionales	Use of if, else, switch statements
Gestor_de_inventarios	Application to manage product inventory
HoursConverter	Converts hours to other formats
Libreta_de_Contactos	Simple digital contact book
Operadores.java	Use of mathematical and logical operators
SistemaCalificaciones	Grade calculation and management system
SistemaRegistroVentas	Basic sales registration system

‚úÖ Requirements
Java JDK 8 or higher installed

A code editor like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or simply use the terminal

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Exercises
From the terminal, compile and run a .java file with the following commands:

mathematica
Copiar
Editar
javac FileName.java
java FileName
Example:

nginx
Copiar
Editar
javac Calculadora_basica/Calculadora.java
java Calculadora
Make sure you're in the root folder of the project or navigate to the correct directory before compiling.

üéØ Repository Purpose
This repository is for educational and practice purposes. Each exercise is designed to strengthen Java programming fundamentals by solving real-world problems.

üìå Next Steps
Add more object-oriented programming exercises

Implement examples using classes and inheritance

Create applications with graphical interfaces (Swing/JavaFX)

Add unit tests using JUnit
