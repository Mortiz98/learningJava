# üß† Learning Java

This repository contains a collection of exercises and small projects developed as part of my journey to learn the **Java** programming language. The topics range from the basics (operators, conditionals, loops) to more structured applications like calculators, inventory managers, and sales systems.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder contains one or more `.java` files that cover a specific concept or solve a particular problem.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later
- Code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code

From your terminal, you can compile and run a `.java` file like this:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
Example:

bash
Copiar
Editar
javac Calculadora_basica/Calculator.java
java Calculator
Make sure to navigate to the corresponding folder before compiling the file.

üéØ Repository Purpose
This repository is intended for educational and practice purposes. Each project reinforces Java programming fundamentals by solving real-world inspired problems.

üìå Next Steps
 Add more object-oriented programming (OOP) exercises

 Implement examples using classes and inheritance

 Build GUI applications (Swing or JavaFX)

 Add unit tests with JUnit
